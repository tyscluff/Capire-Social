# Capire-Social

This was a side project that I started making based around the idea of letting athletes and influencers to be able to have more 1 on 1 interaction with their fans. The idea is that a user can find a stream of someone they're interested in and once they're in a stream they will receive messages from that person, and be able to message them. Requires the Capire-Social backend api. I also did this just because I wanted to see what the process for getting an app into the AppStore is like so this was in the AppStore and PlayStore for a few months.
